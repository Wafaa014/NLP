# NLP
I am starting a journey to implement various NLP related projects. Each project will include a detailed explanation of the problem statement as well as results, I hope that you have fun going through it.

**1- Language Identification:**

the notebook includes the implementation of different machine learning and deep learning algorithms to solve the language identification task, i.e. given a document, the model is supposed to return the language of the document.
